Hi! My name is Sebastian Sosa, I'm 35 years old and I'm
looking forward to starting my first job as a web
developer.

For most of my adult life I've been working as a
lifeguard in the summers and as a sound designer
during the rest of the year, being part of the Sound
Department for several films, short films,
documentaries and commercials.

In the summer of 2021-2022 I decided to change
careers and pursue my newfound passion for web
development. So I started to learn all I could online
which was enough to pass the entrance test for the
Coding Bootcamp at Hack Academy, which was a full-
time (8 hrs/day) 3 month long course in which we learn the skills to
build professional full stack web applications like a
Twitter clone and an E-Commerce.
